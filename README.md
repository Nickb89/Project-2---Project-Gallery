# Project 2 - Project-Gallery

This will become a simple project gallery to display all of the projects I complete as part of my application. 

This project has helped me to learn:

Flexbox 
Javascript syntax
JSON files and using information to manipulate the DOM
using a loop in code to repeat an action

I also researched latest trends in website layouts and best practice
